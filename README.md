# FlightTicket-iOS

This is a new designed app to test collection View and business logic, by getting data from [OPEN Flight API](https://www.data.go.kr/tcs/dss/selectApiDataDetailView.do?publicDataPk=15000126)

### How to run

```
> cd FlightTicket
> open FlightTicket.xcodeproj
```

### App Features

I designed some colored views by using Figma: there are three views below.

<table>
<tr>

</td>
</tr>
</table>

The first one is `main View`: users can choose where to depart and arrive with selected date.

The second one is `Ticket lists View`: users can select results shown.

The third one is `Order View`: the information printed.

### Developing Process 

1. design logo and colored fidelity views

2. get API with verified service key *** (Currently developing) ***

3. make each Views and view controllers

4. check errors with Tests
